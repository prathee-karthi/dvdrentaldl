Predicting Customer Behavior in DVD Rental Using Deep Learning with AWS deployment

DVD Rental Dataset Overview

The DVD rental dataset provides a comprehensive view of rental transactions for a fictional DVD rental company. It includes various details such as the DVD title, rental duration, rental rate, film category, customer information, and transaction dates. This dataset offers rich insights into rental patterns, customer preferences, and film popularity.

By leveraging this dataset, we can build predictive models using deep learning techniques to address key business problems. For instance, demand forecasting can help predict future rental trends based on historical data, while a recommendation system could suggest personalized DVD titles to customers based on their past behavior. Additionally, churn prediction models can identify customers at risk of discontinuing the service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

This dataset is well-suited for applications in machine learning and deep learning, unlocking powerful business insights to improve decision-making, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability.
